There are 2 different agents implemented using different a strategy and logic. (Swarm is better in my opinion)

##### To play the game against the swarm agent
1. Run the PlayGame notebook inside the Play Game folder.
2. Click on the column in which you wish to drop your token.
3. To play again, run the notebook again.

###### PS: I challenge you to beat my agent. (I haven't beaten it yet!)

> If you run into any error, try updating your libraries or running the notebook again.
